## Exam Proctoring Software Rewrite: Enhancing Efficiency and Performance

This project is a complete rewrite of my professor's exam proctoring program. The original application, developed in Python and compiled with AutoPyToExe, consumed a significant amount of system resources, which proved problematic on the less powerful computers available in our institution's computer labs.

My primary motivation for this rewrite is to drastically **reduce resource consumption** and improve overall performance. The new version aims to be a lightweight yet robust solution that can efficiently:

* **Register network events:** Monitor and log network activity during exams to detect unauthorized communication.
* **Process monitoring:** Track running processes to identify forbidden applications or attempts to access external resources.
* **Keystroke logging:** Record keyboard input for review, assisting in verifying student activity and identifying suspicious patterns.
* **AI detection:** Implement features to identify potential use of artificial intelligence tools during examinations.

**Note:** This program is developed solely for **educational purposes** and for internal use within an academic setting to ensure exam integrity.
